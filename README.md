# MST-housing-price-prediction
Mean Square Terrors machine learning project for predicting Kaggle housing prices

## Goals
1. Predict housing prices better than any other group
2. GOTO 10

## Outline

### Explore Data (8/15)
- Get familiar with what's present in the data
- Demonstration of EDA skills:
  - Numeric methodology.
  - Graphic methodology.

### Clean Data (8/16-8/17)
- Remove or impute missing data
- Create new desired variables based on what's already present in the data

### Supplement Data (8/18-8/19)
- Obtain potentially-relevent data using our domain knowledge
- Produce merged dataset

### Test Machine Learning Methods (8/20-8/23)
- Test several ML methods we'll be exposed to by the end of the program and decide which are viable
- Demonstration of machine learning skills:
  - Supervised methodology.
  - Unsupervised methodology.

### Combine Models (8/23-8/24)
- Weight results with different methods
- Ability to assess model weaknesses and identify improvements.

### Create Presentation (8/25-8/26)
- Leave final weekend to make a polished 20-minute presentation and practice delivery
- Communication of motivation: why do we care?
- Research questions of interest: what do you want to find out?
- Answers to research questions: what have you uncovered?
